	* gtk-osx-bootstrap.modules:
	* gtk-osx-gstreamer.modules:
	* gtk-osx-gtkmm.modules:
	* gtk-osx-python.modules:
	* gtk-osx-random.modules:
	* gtk-osx-themes.modules:
	* gtk-osx-universal.modules:
	* gtk-osx-webkit-deps.modules:
	* gtk-osx.modules: Rework things to make the moduleset easier to
	maintain. The main file, gtk-osx.modules, includes the others.

	* jhbuildrc-gtk-osx: Make the core and bootstrap meta modules be
	the default ones, this allows building gtk+ and its dependencies
	out of the box. Don't make the gtk+ modules depend on the
	bootstrap modules, this makes it possible to rebuild only the
	interesting pieces, and not have to go through libxml2, libxslt,
	etc etc, by overriding the default modules to build.
	- Also make it possible to have a custom rc file names
	~/.jhbuildrc-custom that can override things from the regular one,
	makes it easier to have different setups, for example a universal
	buuild, and one for gstreamer, one without etc.

2007-10-29  Richard Hult  <richard@imendio.com>

	* jhbuildrc-gtk-osx: Set the debug format to stabs+3 since the
	default changed in leopard and we don't want to use dwarf since it
	doesn't work that well with auto*.

2007-08-23  Richard Hult  <richard@imendio.com>

	* gtk-osx.modules: Add doxygen, libsigc++2, glibmm, cairomm,
	gtkmm, poppler. Note that those don't build out of the box, some
	manual tweaking is needed. Also add dbus and dbus-glib, untested.

	* gtk-osx-build: Update cairo tarball to 1.4.10.

2007-04-24  Richard Hult  <richard@imendio.com>

	* gtk-osx-build: Put all the gnu software in a mirror at
	people.imendio.com, should help downloading the bootstrap
	packages, since the gnu server seems very slow or down even
	sometimes.

2007-04-20  Richard Hult  <richard@imendio.com>

	* gtk-osx-build: Improve comments and add note about cloning cairo
	taking a while.
